//		Access modifiers are keywords in java that help us control the access of
//		classes, variables, methods and other code of block. There are four access levels in java:

//		1. private 2. default 3.protected 4.public.
//		
//	    PRIVATE: When we use the private keyword with a method or field it is only accessible
//		inside that class. It is the most restricted access modifier.

//		DEFAULT (it's not a keyword):
//		When we dont use any access modifier keyword with a field or method then default access
//      is applied by java which means we can access this variable or method inside
//      the same as well as in all the other classes which exists inside the same package

//		PROTECTED: 
//      When we have protected access mofifier we can access that method od variable inside
//      the same class + inside the other classes which are inside the same package + inside
//      the classes which are in different packages as well but they must have
//      'extends' relationship with the original class

//      PUBLIC:
//      We can use methods/ variables/ etc anywhere insidesame project
