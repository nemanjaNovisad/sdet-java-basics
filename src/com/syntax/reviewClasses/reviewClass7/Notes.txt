Types of variables in java:
    We have three types of variables 1) local 2)instance 3)static.
Local variables:
    Are the variables that we declared inside a block of code
    upSide:They occupy the memory for shortest period of time
    downSide: They can't be accessed outside that block in which they are declared.
Instance Variables:
    Are the variables that are declared inside a class but outside a block of code.
    upSIde: Can be accessed in all the methods of class. They can have different values for each
    instance of that class.

Static variable
    All the variables which are defined outside a block of code with static keyword they are
    called static variables.
    upSide:
    1) They only reserve a single memory location for all the instances of a class.
    2) They can be accessed by just writing the name of the class and variable name.
    downSide:
    The occupy the memory for longest period of time they always store only one value
    for all the objects of that class.

Real life use:
    Most of the time you will be storing constant values in static variables.
    static is also used heavily with methods that don't involve instance variables
Access modifiers:
    There are 3 access modifier keywords(private protected public) and
    four access levels(private default protected public) in java.
Rules:
    Access modifiers can only be used with instance and static members
    of a class(fields and methods)
private:
    when we use private with any method or variable we can only access that method or
    variable in that class.

Default(it's not a keyword):
    we can access that member inside the same class inside the same package in other classes.
public:
    when we use the public access modifier with members of a class it is available throughout
    that project.
Real Life use:
    99 % of the time instance fields are private.
    99 % of the time instance and static methods are public.
